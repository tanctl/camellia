# Simple Arithmetic Test Circuit
# This circuit computes (x + y) * z and constrains the result

circuit test_arithmetic {
    # Public inputs
    public inputs: x, y
    
    # Private inputs
    private inputs: z
    
    # Circuit computation
    sum = x + y
    product = sum * z
    assert product == 42
}

# This circuit demonstrates:
# - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication)
# - Mixed public and private inputs
# - Constraint generation for equality checking
